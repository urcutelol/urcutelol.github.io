When I first saw you I truly thought you were beautiful but i was too scared to say anything at all. Months later we finally started to talk a little bit because of dance practice and in those few days i had completely fallen for you. I see a future with no one but you and any challenges that may come in the future I’m ready to take them on as long as I have you by my side. Each time I talk to you I will try to make you smile and make sure you have a good time with me. Talking you has made me want these last few days of school to extend just so I can see you more often. Each day I think of complementing you but words aren’t enough to express how beautiful I truly think you are. Not only on the outside but I’ve fallen for how kind you are and being around makes me genuinely happy. I know that this may seem too soon as it’s only been a couple days but being able to talk to you has made this last week of my life 100 times better. I always check my notifications to see if you have texted me and whenever you do nothing else matters to me. I want to see you talk and smile more and I hope I can become the cause of that. These few sentences aren’t nearly enough to truly express how I feel about you but it will have to do for now. I will miss being around you during the summer and I hope to stay connected to you through messages and calls/facetime. Hopefully in the future I will be able to call you dad and mom sasu bau and sasu ama. Finally I hope you have an amazing summer and this gift will remind you of me.<br><br>
